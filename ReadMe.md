## üîß Getting Started

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è To apply the framework:

1. Run `data.py` to prepare the dataset.
2. Then sequentially execute the following scripts:
   - `c1_code/c1_train.py`
   - `c1_code/c1_main.py`
   - `c3_code/c2_main.py`
   - `c3_code/c3_main.py`
   - `c3_code/c3_final_embeddings.py`

These steps will preprocess the data, train the model, and generate the final embeddings.

### üß† To check Grad-CAM results:

Simply run:

```bash
python Grad_CAM_main.py
